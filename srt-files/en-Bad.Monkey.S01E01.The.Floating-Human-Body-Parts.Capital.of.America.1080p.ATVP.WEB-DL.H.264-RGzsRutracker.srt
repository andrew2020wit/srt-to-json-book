1
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,926
<i>So, here's the thing
about fishing stories…</i>

2
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,055
<i>they always start on a boat.</i>

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,314
<i>It was a thick, hot Florida day.</i>

4
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,234
<i>You wouldn't know it
from all the expensive gear,</i>

5
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,778
<i>but James Mayberry
had never fished before.</i>

6
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,322
- Locked in? I'm good. Is it good?
- Good? There you go.

7
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,866
- Yeah. Let's do it.
- All right, here we go.

8
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,828
<i>You know what they say,
you always remember your first time.</i>

9
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:40,707
Lou! Louisa!
Honey, I still don't have that beer.

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,001
- Can we fix that, please?
- Okay.

11
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,419
I said okay.

12
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,798
Gotta love a honeymoon charter.
Warms the heart.

13
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,804
You're fun to talk to.
You got a real spark.

14
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,516
Fish on! Game time, boys!

15
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,185
Christ.

16
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,062
- Will you give me some space, please?
- Geez.

17
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,730
I got a fish. I'm getting it.

18
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,776
Get it up. There it is.

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,611
Yeah! Bring it in, baby.

20
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,822
- What the fuck! Shit!
- Oh, my God!

21
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,324
- What is that?
- That's not a fish.

22
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,368
- Oh, my God!
- Captain, that's not a fish!

23
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,870
- Yeah, I see that.
- Oh, my God!

24
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,372
- Yo, check out his finger, dude.
- Sick!

25
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,166
What do you think, maybe a shark got him?
I'm thinking Great White.

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,127
Seen my fair share of shark shows.

27
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,921
That's how it happens. One minute,
you're kicking it. Next minute, boom!

28
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,214
Chewed to shit.

29
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,091
I gotta radio the Coast Guard.

30
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:34,386
You do that. I'm gonna text my friends.
Muggo's gonna shit his pants.

31
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,181
We're in the memory-making business.

32
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,558
Oh, yeah.

33
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,323
<i>Andrew Yancy's cell phone
had been ringing all morning,</i>

34
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:58,076
<i>but he had chosen to ignore it.
It was too nice a day.</i>

35
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,585
<i>He was a simple man,
and as such, he enjoyed simple pleasures.</i>

36
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:10,964
<i>A good drink now and then.
A chair with a view.</i>

37
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,134
<i>And most importantly,
a place to call home.</i>

38
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,553
<i>He loved damn near all of it.</i>

39
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,685
<i>He didn't even mind
the occasional uninvited visitor</i>

40
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,395
<i>that munched on his bushes.</i>

41
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,528
<i>This was his happy place.</i>

42
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,573
Yancy, you ever answer your phone?

43
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,659
Easy, loud feet.

44
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,911
Look at this handsome guy over here.

45
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,330
Those things are covered in ticks.

46
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,626
Jesus.

47
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,045
You know, there's so much construction
around nowadays

48
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,839
that the Key deer barely even come around.

49
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,883
Can you believe the size of that dump?
I'm gonna burn it down.

50
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:55,968
Don't burn it down.

51
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,512
I'll make sure no one's inside,
but it's gonna burn.

52
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:02,307
Okay. Burn it down. Sonny wants you
to take a quick road trip to Miami.

53
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:06,186
The county code is 35 feet,
and this shitheap here is 45 feet.

54
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,605
It's the Keys, bro.
No one follows the building code.

55
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,942
Okay, you, Miami,
a little police business.

56
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,361
- In and out.
- I can't do it, Ro.

57
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,196
I'm technically
not even a detective anymore.

58
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,781
Do we really have to do this dance?

59
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,449
Who's dancing? There's no dance.

60
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,493
I'm suspended. What-- How am I dancing?

61
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,121
- No, it's the, like-- The back-and-forth.
- There's no back-and-forth.

62
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,165
My brother, you want your job back
very badly, right?

63
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,917
- Yes.
- Well, I've got something in my car

64
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,253
that the sheriff wants you
to drive to Miami.

65
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,838
Look at me, I'm falling asleep.

66
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,132
- I'm so tired.
- Yeah. I know you have your pride.

67
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,717
So, if you wanna pretend for a minute

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,760
that you don't wanna do this errand,
that's fine.

69
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,264
But don't make me stand around here
for fucking ever holding my dick.

70
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,516
People can't suspend me
and then expect things from me.

71
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,893
- It's not how it works.
- Whatever.

72
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,395
That's Barbancourt. Right?

73
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,396
Thankfully, yes.

74
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,231
But I unfortunately
don't have a glass for you.

75
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:52,524
I'll take yours.

76
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,071
<i>Before he got suspended,
Yancy and Ro were partners,</i>

77
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,491
<i>and hell, sometimes that's even worse
than being married.</i>

78
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,831
<i>Over the years, Ro had learned how to get
exactly what he wanted from his friend.</i>

79
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,170
<i>All it took was a little patience.</i>

80
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,223
So what's in the car?

81
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,579
That's all they found?

82
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,664
No, man, the head's in the passenger seat.

83
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,583
If you're too grouchy
to answer the question,

84
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,209
just say, "I'm too grouchy to answer."

85
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,128
Don't have to hit me
with the "head in the passenger seat."

86
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,505
It's already been over to the coroner.
He says

87
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,091
the vic was a "white male, mid-40s."

88
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:45,137
<i>Says that the middle finger thing
was probably just "random rigor mortis."</i>

89
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,471
He still took a picture with it.

90
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,599
<i>Such a dipshit.</i>

91
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,102
I'm late for Natalia's soccer game.

92
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,854
I would absolutely love to come,

93
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,856
except I would rather
do literally anything

94
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,026
other than watch children play soccer.
But I got it.

95
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,779
Hey, do me a favor.

96
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,407
No coaching from the sideline,
not getting hot and yelling.

97
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,576
I know you're Puerto Rican,
but do your best.

98
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:11,705
You sure you wanna leave it
out there all night? Shit's evidence, man.

99
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,040
Who's gonna jack an arm?

100
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,959
I don't know, raccoons?
They got those little fingers.

101
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:18,837
Here we go. We're taking it in.

102
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,006
- Thank you.
- Yep. You got it.

103
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,424
Call me when you get to Miami.

104
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,885
I can't hear you.
I'm already done talking with you.

105
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,846
<i>Like I said, just like a married couple.</i>

106
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,931
Love you.

107
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,644
Andrew, I can't have that arm here.

108
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,522
Negative publicity like this,
not good for business.

109
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,941
- It'll hurt tourism.
- <i>That's horseshit, Sonny.</i>

110
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,485
<i>The sheriff was a local bubba
named Sonny Summers.</i>

111
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,280
<i>He won office 'cause he was
the only candidate not in federal custody.</i>

112
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:48,617
First of all,
that floating arm can't hurt tourism.

113
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,286
Nothing's gonna keep these fucking idiots
out of the water.

114
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,040
That beach on the Rickenbacker Causeway
is filled with raw sewage.

115
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,086
People are still out there every day
just swimming in shit, Sonny.

116
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,796
<i>Look, this is different, okay?</i>

117
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,466
The clown who reeled in the damn thing
already posted a pic on social media.

118
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,928
Goddamn it.
I'm gonna nip this in the butt.

119
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,097
Bud, right? You nip things in the bud.

120
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,933
Maybe you do. I need that arm gone.

121
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,937
Sonny, the odds of that limb floating
down here are pretty fucking slim.

122
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,814
<i>The Gulf Stream flows north.</i>

123
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,023
No, duh. I was born here.

124
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,775
What if Miami doesn't take the arm?

125
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,443
<i>Persuade them.</i>

126
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,737
Bottom line, tomorrow I'm announcing

127
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,990
that the investigation has been
turned over to the authorities

128
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,366
of Miami-Dade County.

129
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,036
- Counting on you here.
- Yeah, that doesn't seem smart.

130
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,413
Listen to me.

131
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,707
I'm only gonna go up there
on one condition.

132
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,293
<i>I am dying at home.</i>

133
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,044
I need you to lift my suspension.

134
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,173
You're gonna have to talk
to your girlfriend. Bonnie's your problem.

135
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,008
And she didn't think twice
about telling the ADA

136
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,011
that you violently and deliberately
assaulted her husband.

137
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,346
That's why I never,
ever think with my dick.

138
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,807
Yeah. You're actually known for that.
You do zero dick thinking.

139
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,018
<i>Our love is like a streaking comet.</i>

140
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,062
Those are her words. Not mine.
Kind of pretty though.

141
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,939
<i>It might have been from
one of the books she gave me.</i>

142
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,108
- Get the arm out of my town.
- <i>She gives me books.</i>

143
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,495
<i>Yancy didn't love driving to Miami.</i>

144
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,956
<i>A lot of bad memories up there.</i>

145
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:22,336
<i>On the other hand, it did feel good
to be doing any kind of police work again.</i>

146
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,630
<i>It'd been a while.</i>

147
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,242
Hey, how's it going?

148
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,161
It's going. May I help you?

149
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:58,872
My name is Andrew Yancy.
I'm from the Keys.

150
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,543
And please help yourself to a popsicle,
but crabs are off-limits.

151
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,169
I'm gonna eat those later.

152
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:06,839
Okay.

153
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,174
That's a random rigor mortis.

154
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,677
I feel weird even saying it to you
'cause you would know that probably.

155
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,394
Got a lot of elbow room in here,
must be nice for a workspace.

156
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,812
It's like an open floor plan.

157
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:26,108
Everyone wants this in their work now.
More open, less close.

158
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,365
I don't mind morgues,
especially in the summer.

159
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,783
Nice and cool.

160
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,535
Always around 60 degrees, you know?

161
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,581
I'm so sorry. I completely forgot to ask
you what your feelings on morgues were.

162
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,249
Are you being mean or funny?

163
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,584
Mean funny. Now, please.

164
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,128
Totally.

165
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,297
I'm no shark expert.

166
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,465
Gonna have to bother a marine biologist
for that one.

167
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:55,929
Okay, Dr. Rosa Campesino.
I like your name.

168
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,014
I feel blessed.

169
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,809
So you brought this all the way
from the Keys because…

170
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:03,604
My sheriff felt
that this particular appendage

171
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,815
might belong to one of your victims
and could hopefully stay here in Miami,

172
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,400
where random severed arms

173
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,111
are an everyday thing. So, pretty please?

174
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:14,573
Yeah, I've got the county's
current inventory

175
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,074
- on body parts.
- Okay?

176
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:21,580
And none of them match a black-haired,
white male in his 40s.

177
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,373
Fucknuts.

178
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:24,833
Fucknuts, for real.

179
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,085
But did you notice his watch is missing?

180
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:28,837
You see this?

181
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:31,465
If someone took that, you know,
that could make it a homicide.

182
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:35,177
Yeah, well, my sheriff is not gonna love
the word homicide.

183
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,721
How about this? Maybe the shark
that mangled the poor fucker

184
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,805
also likes to eat watches.

185
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:43,393
I mean, if someone took the watch, why
would they not swipe the wedding ring too?

186
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,728
That looks like it's platinum.

187
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,356
Look at you making a good point.

188
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,149
That's not the first time. Ask around.

189
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:52,444
You know what,
that humerus is hacked up pretty bad.

190
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,988
Now we're talking.
Maybe the guy went out fishing by himself.

191
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,783
He's a lonely gentleman. And then
he backed into the boat's propeller.

192
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,285
- That's how my grandfather died.
- No, he didn't.

193
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,871
Yeah, he's still alive.
But you know, could've happened.

194
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,581
Yeah, maybe.

195
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,792
It does look a little like
a propeller wound.

196
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,711
Definitely propeller-like,
if not all the way, it's a propeller.

197
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,339
- You're good.
- Still doesn't make it my problem.

198
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:13,924
You're killing me, Rosa.

199
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,218
Please don't say
what I think you're about to say.

200
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,554
Sorry, not my case.

201
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:24,518
Making jokes with the dead
is very, very bad luck.

202
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,397
Mango. All right.

203
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,524
You're not a complete dummy after all.

204
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,651
Yeah. Yeah, mango's the best.

205
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,904
You should take this back to the Keys.
You know, just wait around,

206
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,240
see if someone shows up
looking for a missing husband.

207
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,950
What if nobody shows up?

208
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,786
Rosa, it's a cold business
when true love goes south.

209
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,746
- True that.
- Love everything about you

210
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,165
and this place, other than the fact
that you didn't take the arm.

211
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,250
Bye.

212
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,465
Well, surprise, surprise.

213
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,010
They didn't take the fucking arm.
So now what do you want me to do?

214
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,846
The ball. Natalia! Get the ball!

215
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,389
Hey, hey, don't yell at her!

216
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,891
<i>Put an "I love you" on top of that.</i>

217
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,768
With the same energy you were taking
her head off with, Bobby Knight.

218
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,188
- I love you!
- <i>It's better, much better.</i>

219
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:10,981
What do you want me to do
with this fucking thing?

220
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,401
The cooler's starting to smell like old
onions and not a good s-- onion. A bad--

221
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,320
The whole car smells like death.

222
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,404
Just lose it somewhere.

223
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,406
I have no idea
what brand of cooler this is,

224
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,701
but they better not claim they keep
smells in because they absolutely don't.

225
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:23,785
Okay, listen to me.

226
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:27,873
You got me driving around with a cooler
that doesn't live up to its promises.

227
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,124
<i>Jesus Christ. Focus.</i>

228
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,668
Take 905 back through North Key Largo.

229
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,546
There are canals back there
loaded with hungry crocs.

230
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,769
I don't know. I'll think about it, Ro.

231
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:52,731
I really wish you wouldn't.
When has thinking ever worked out for you?

232
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,363
<i>Why are you so okay throwing an arm out?</i>

233
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,240
You're acting
like it's your mother-in-law's arm,

234
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:02,574
but what if it was your mom's arm?

235
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:03,867
Come on, man.

236
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,246
<i>No one's coming for that,
and Sonny wants it gone.</i>

237
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:08,997
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

238
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:34,523
But, what if this wasn't an accident?
It doesn't feel right.

239
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,860
I'm begging you for once,
do what's right for you.

240
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,444
Ditch the fucking arm and come home.

241
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,662
<i>Yancy knew that to get his job back</i>

242
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,831
<i>all he had to do was stay out of trouble,</i>

243
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:55,294
<i>unfortunately, trouble always
seemed to come looking for him.</i>

244
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,634
That smells great.

245
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:03,760
I'll open the wine.

246
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,971
Hey,
you're still testifying against me, right?

247
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:12,269
Okay.

248
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,651
I got you something.

249
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:21,570
Oh, good, a book.

250
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:23,864
Why does this keep happening?

251
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,574
- You'll love it.
- Yeah.

252
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:26,909
It's like it's about you.

253
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,329
It looks long. I'm not that complicated.

254
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:34,499
2009, Bordeaux,
I should have decanted it for a bit.

255
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,959
Sip it.

256
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:38,754
Sorry.

257
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,131
So, where is the good doctor?

258
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,843
- Cliff's in Lauderdale.
- Uh-huh.

259
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,221
He's got a meeting tomorrow
with our bankers.

260
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,097
Must be nice to have bankers.

261
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,016
Don't be pedestrian, Andrew.

262
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,685
Tell me again why he isn't divorcing you.

263
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:54,978
Cliff adores me.

264
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,189
- Even after he caught us together?
- Uh-huh.

265
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,690
- Really?
- Yes.

266
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,484
I'm easy to forgive, Andrew.

267
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,324
You know, I think Sonny would…

268
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,785
- Oh, my--
- …lift my suspension

269
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:13,080
if you could get Cliff
to drop the charges.

270
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,123
That's why you invited me over tonight.

271
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:16,667
That's a false statement.

272
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,169
I invited you here every night this week.

273
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,255
It's true. I'm sorry.

274
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:25,384
I guess I didn't call you back
'cause I just feel like whatever this is

275
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,886
has reached its natural end.

276
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,014
A trial would be embarrassing
for everyone.

277
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,643
Especially your husband,
the alleged victim.

278
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,063
Alleged?

279
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:42,276
<i>Andrew! Are you serious?</i>

280
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,072
The fuck?

281
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:51,410
<i>I mean, I wasn't the only witness.</i>

282
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:54,454
Everyone heard him screaming,

283
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:57,291
"Stop, stop, stop!"

284
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:07,384
<i>Well, I mean,
he did call you a whore prior to that.</i>

285
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,927
I was cheating on him!

286
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,304
And he slapped you.

287
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:13,390
Hard.

288
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:15,893
Really is a good year.

289
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,480
Well, I suppose I should go.

290
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:44,922
You really should decant that.

291
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:46,798
We finished the good stuff.

292
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:50,052
This is from a box in the garage.

293
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:53,388
You know, the detective in me
really gets why Cliff wouldn't leave you.

294
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:57,392
I mean, he's 60.
Not necessarily a head-turner.

295
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,770
You could stop traffic. You're barely 40.

296
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,523
Forty-two and you know it, but thank you.

297
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:03,899
But why wouldn't you leave him?

298
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:07,694
He's a piece of shit,
pill-pushing dermatologist.

299
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,488
You'd get plenty in the split.

300
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,281
Does he have something on you?

301
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,951
No more than I do on him.

302
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,954
You should see his internet history.
He's a total perv.

303
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,955
You ever get choked
while pleasuring yourself?

304
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,999
One time. But it was not on purpose.

305
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,877
I was wearing a tie
and then I kind of tripped.

306
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,300
Okay. You win, Andrew.

307
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,053
I'll talk to Cliff again tomorrow.

308
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,137
Thank you.

309
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:39,476
I really like being a detective and…

310
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,397
you know, I don't like a lot of things so…

311
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,315
Yeah.

312
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,610
I need some ice in my wine. You?

313
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,112
I'm good.

314
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,411
Andrew! God, no!

315
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,372
- Whose is that?
- Oh, fuck. Bonnie!

316
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:01,707
It's not what you think it is.

317
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,335
Well, it's exactly what you think
it is, but it's-- Good explanation.

318
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:07,963
Hey, hold on!

319
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,631
- Bonnie!
- Christ! What did you do?

320
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:12,301
I didn't do anything! You're overreacting!

321
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:24,813
<i>Before I go any further here,</i>

322
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:28,734
<i>I gotta tell you a little story
about a young man over in the Bahamas.</i>

323
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:33,447
<i>Now, I know it's annoying to leave
this story just when it's getting fun,</i>

324
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,116
<i>but I promise it'll make sense eventually.</i>

325
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,203
<i>Just be patient.</i>

326
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:04,102
<i>It's hard to imagine someone
living a simpler life than Andrew Yancy,</i>

327
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,563
<i>but Neville Stafford sure as hell did.</i>

328
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:11,568
<i>His days were filled with fishing,
eating those fish, and not much else.</i>

329
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,822
<i>Heck, as long as Neville had
his little shack in paradise,</i>

330
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,282
<i>he was good to go.</i>

331
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,619
<i>It was his happy place too.</i>

332
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:28,418
<i>And it shouldn't be lost on you that,
just like Yancy,</i>

333
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:32,589
<i>Neville considered all the nature
around him to be close, personal friends.</i>

334
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:33,590
Hey, little man.

335
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,844
Mr. Stafford.

336
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,305
Mr. Stafford.

337
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,766
Neville. What do you want?

338
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,017
Can we talk a bit?

339
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:48,939
<i>Luckily, Neville had
a buddy inside for backup.</i>

340
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:52,442
<i>Their partnership was
also like a marriage.</i>

341
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,654
No! Bad monkey. Bad.

342
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,948
Jesus, boy.

343
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,700
Where did you get that ugly thing?

344
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:02,119
Speak kindly or Driggs will fuck you up.

345
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:06,415
I won him in a game of dominoes
against an old man in Fresh Creek.

346
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,500
He owed me money. So he told me…

347
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,294
<i>"Driggs is one of the trained monkeys</i>

348
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,880
<i>from the very last Johnny Depp
pirate movie they made out here."</i>

349
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,842
<i>He said I could literally teach him
to do anything I wanted.</i>

350
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,513
Driggs, up.

351
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:26,143
Up. Up, up, up!

352
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:29,479
That old man was full of shit.

353
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,733
Now, what do you mean,
I have to leave my home?

354
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:34,985
We sent notices.

355
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:37,654
I've been fishing.

356
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,615
- For a month?
- I like fishing.

357
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,575
They're putting up a resort here.

358
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,411
An American gentleman
by the name of Christopher.

359
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,246
He's been buying up all the land.

360
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,123
Discussion over. I'm not selling.

361
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:49,583
But it's not up to you.

362
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,793
Your half-sister, Samara, in Florida,

363
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:55,297
she's the official trustee,
and she's sold already.

364
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,091
How can she do this?

365
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:01,887
Easy now.
She got to split the money with you.

366
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:05,182
The whole resort's going to be top shelf.

367
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:09,269
Going to have a tiki bar,
freshwater pools over there,

368
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:12,189
clay tennis courts, a spa.

369
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,943
They're gonna call it Curly Tail Lane.

370
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:18,737
Green Beach is what my father
always called this place.

371
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,155
Maybe once upon a time.

372
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:24,743
<i>He was afraid to tell
the government man what he really thought.</i>

373
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:25,827
Can I get another beer?

374
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:27,621
<i>He got over it.</i>

375
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:28,956
Get the fuck off my land.

376
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,713
<i>Neville wasn't the only one
feeling like the world was out to get him.</i>

377
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:39,424
<i>For the tenth time, Bonnie,
I didn't chop anyone up.</i>

378
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,218
Call me back.

379
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:45,681
<i>Luckily for Yancy,
he had someone to take it out on.</i>

380
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:48,183
What do you mean your clients
can't find the house?

381
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,687
I just told you the big yellow one.

382
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:54,398
Hey, excuse me.

383
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:01,071
There's a dead raccoon in my house.

384
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,906
<i>This was not news to Yancy.</i>

385
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,449
Not good. How'd it get there?

386
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,534
I don't know.

387
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,911
The damn thing looks like it got pancaked
by a truck or something.

388
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:09,079
- In your house?
- Yeah.

389
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:11,623
I'm Evan Shook.

390
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,877
- Big dog.
- Okay.

391
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,172
So look, I called animal control,
but I got people coming over any minute.

392
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,215
They flew in from Dallas.
I could really use a hand, bro.

393
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:21,675
Okay, here's the thing--
Evan Shook, is it?

394
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:23,594
- Uh-huh.
- I wanna help you, I do.

395
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:27,347
But it is really bad luck to disturb
a dead animal, and I can't afford that.

396
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:29,099
Bad luck? What are you talking,
voodoo or some shit?

397
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:31,268
No, it's like an instant curse.
You can borrow my shovel.

398
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,645
No! Dude, it reeks to high hell.

399
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:36,565
I'm sure it does. I mean,
dead things usually smell pretty bad.

400
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,152
Shit.

401
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,112
- Hey, peace, bro.
- Yeah.

402
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:45,991
<i>Yancy felt that warm glow he
always got when he made an enemy for life.</i>

403
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,576
Christina, how are you?

404
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,369
What the hell's going on over there?

405
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:50,996
Dead-raccoon situation.

406
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,915
Cool. You got any food?

407
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,210
The reason I came, Sonny sent me.

408
00:22:57,503 --> 00:22:58,879
What'd you ever do with that arm?

409
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:03,300
Well, you told me to toss it
in the canal, so I tossed it.

410
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,351
- I still got it.
- That's what I figured.

411
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:15,020
Wow, you truly never listen to me.

412
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:18,774
Good news, though, because a woman
came in to report her husband missing

413
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:20,859
- from a boating accident.
- Well, that took long enough.

414
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:21,944
She was in Europe.

415
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:25,155
Old man was heading to the Bahamas
on a fishing trip.

416
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:28,867
Here's the kicker,
she wants the fucking arm, man.

417
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:30,035
- S--
- Wow.

418
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,663
She wants to do a church service,
the whole show.

419
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:36,166
- She needs the arm back to bury it.
- Yeah, that's gonna be a tiny casket.

420
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,918
They'll probably
have a regular-size casket.

421
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,378
That's a big waste of wood.

422
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:44,091
You know, I should be getting major
brownie points for this from Sonny.

423
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:48,554
Could you imagine how ugly the press
would be if you lost a dead guy's arm?

424
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:50,013
Jesus, man.

425
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,142
All right, Sonny's gonna tell the widow

426
00:23:54,226 --> 00:24:00,607
that you're the authorized custodian
of the unclaimed remains or some shit.

427
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:03,318
Her name's Eve, as in Christmas.

428
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,404
Stripling as in stripper.

429
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:08,866
- I'm listening.
- All right, here's her number.

430
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:12,369
Meet her, give her the arm,
then get the hell out of Dodge.

431
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:15,622
- No talking, no questions.
- Why do you feel like you gotta warn me?

432
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:17,249
You really wanna have this conversation?

433
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:20,586
Yeah, I was hoping to. That's why I said
what I said. Sometimes it's fun to talk.

434
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,630
Just behave, man.
She just lost her husband.

435
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,428
<i>I'm sorry for your loss, Mrs. Stripling.</i>

436
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:33,682
<i>Thank you.
Yeah, it's awful. It's just awful.</i>

437
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:36,685
<i>So, where do you want to meet up?</i>

438
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:39,479
<i>There's a shopping center
about halfway between us.</i>

439
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:42,274
<i>It'll be easy to find me.
I'll be wearing a blue hat.</i>

440
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,204
Hi.

441
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:56,330
Hey.

442
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:59,750
- Are you Detective Yancy?
- And you must be Mrs. Stripling.

443
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,251
Eve's fine.

444
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:02,377
- Hi.
- Hi.

445
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:06,840
This kind of feels like a drug deal.

446
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:13,639
I guess I should take a look, right?

447
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,855
Well, that's how they found it.
You know, just random rigor mortis.

448
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:23,899
It's-- It is weird, I know.

449
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:26,193
It's u-- very unique, but it's--

450
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:29,613
I don't know, but it's uncomfortable.

451
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:32,950
- It's really uncomfortable.
- Yeah.

452
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:39,456
It's his ring. It's definitely him.
This sucks.

453
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:41,542
Fuck!

454
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,627
You doing all right?

455
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,005
I just feel like this isn't even real.
I'm like in a Winn-Dixie, like…

456
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:50,843
looking at my husband's arm, I just--

457
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,931
- I'm gonna take it.
- No, no, I got this.

458
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:01,603
- Thanks.
- So, they ever find Nick's boat?

459
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:05,315
No. They just found
some cushions and spare gas cans.

460
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:09,570
There was a fuel slick, like five miles
off the coast of Sombrero Lighthouse.

461
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:11,822
Anybody else on board?

462
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,574
Just my Nicky.

463
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:16,952
He was on his way up
to Cay Sal to meet up with some friends.

464
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:21,206
<i>Yancy knew with all of his heart
that the smart move was to say goodbye</i>

465
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:25,919
<i>to Eve Stripling and the arm that smelled
like onions and never look back.</i>

466
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:27,379
Let's sit in the car.

467
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,798
- I-- No, I'm so sorry. I--
- Just a few questions, all routine.

468
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:31,550
I actually have to go.

469
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:36,346
When did you learn Nick was missing?

470
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,473
I was in Paris.

471
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:41,018
Yeah, it was a birthday present from Nick.

472
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:42,603
So were these.

473
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:44,813
- Fancy.
- Thanks.

474
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:47,774
- They were like ten grand.
- Why are we whispering?

475
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:49,943
I don't know.

476
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,323
Anyway, I hadn't heard from him,
but like that's super normal.

477
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:56,325
When he's on the islands
I never hear from him

478
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:58,327
because the cell service out there
is suck-o.

479
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,704
He was supposed to come home
the Sunday after I did.

480
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,040
And when he didn't show, at first
I was like, "Oh, this--

481
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:05,667
The fishing must be
super great." I didn't really--

482
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:10,672
Why are you not writing any of this?

483
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:12,090
I'll remember it.

484
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:13,884
You'd make a really great waiter.

485
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,845
I actually get that a lot.
Although in practice, terrible waiter.

486
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,097
Yeah, they fired me.
They said I was too gregarious.

487
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:20,265
I talked too much to the clients.

488
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,893
Anyway, like I said, this is just routine.

489
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:27,356
So, Wednesday comes and still no Nick.

490
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,900
And then that's
when the Coast Guard told me

491
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:31,693
what they found.

492
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:36,490
Oh, my God,
he loved that damn fishing boat.

493
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:38,951
He named it <i>Summer's Eve, </i>after me.

494
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:43,080
You know that's also the name of--

495
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:46,834
You know what?
Forget it. It's a lovely gesture.

496
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,001
Are we done?

497
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:50,587
Almost. Did you have any children?

498
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:53,799
No, we didn't. I mean,
he has his daughter and she's totally…

499
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:57,135
so lovely.

500
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:01,765
And she's actually coming down
for the service on Saturday.

501
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:06,353
It still just

502
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:08,856
doesn't seem real.

503
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:18,615
Again, I'm sorry for your loss.

504
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,243
Thank you.

505
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,961
<i>You should've seen it.
She had her mouth all scrunched up,</i>

506
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:33,714
<i>and she was panting a little,
but there was no noise.</i>

507
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:34,798
<i>So what?</i>

508
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:37,092
I'm telling you,
she was trying very, very hard to cry.

509
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:40,554
Okay, so you're saying
that you saw the expression on her face

510
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,514
through the car window
as the car was driving by.

511
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:45,267
I know what I saw, Rosa. I'm sure of it.

512
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:48,979
You know, also I guess I could be wrong
'cause it was hard to see.

513
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:52,608
But get this, she said this afternoon
she's popping over to the Bahamas

514
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:54,693
<i>for a few days, just to be sad.</i>

515
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:56,361
<i>So? You don't know how people grieve.</i>

516
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:59,865
Come on, Tilly. Come on, you silly girl.

517
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:02,743
<i>I know that they don't usually
do it on beaches.</i>

518
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,119
Hi!

519
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:07,456
Gorgeous day in paradise!

520
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:09,458
Come on, sweetie pie.

521
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,044
Fine.
You know everything about everything.

522
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:16,089
What is with all the storm clouds?
You look angry at the world.

523
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:20,260
Well, spent my entire morning
autopsying a 15-year-old girl

524
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:24,097
who got shot yesterday at her own
<i>quinceañera </i>by her mom's boyfriend, so…

525
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:28,060
Now I feel like a asshole--
I'm sorry, Rosa, that's tough.

526
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:31,396
That is a-- That's a challenging day.

527
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,149
Yeah.

528
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:39,112
So, what? You wanna know
what the state has on Nick Stripling?

529
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:40,447
Yeah.

530
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:45,410
Why did you drive all the way up here
to see me again?

531
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:48,413
I mean, why not check the state files
at your station?

532
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:50,499
I didn't come all the way up here
just to see you again.

533
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:52,751
I was halfway when I met the widow.

534
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:55,712
Then I just came into town to have dinner
with a friend, Tommy Biscayne.

535
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:59,758
And it's not a great time for me
to be at my station fishing around.

536
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,053
The last part was true,
the rest of it's not.

537
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:04,930
I don't know anyone named Tommy Biscayne.

538
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:08,517
There you go.

539
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,812
When he was 24 years old,
he had a minor role in an insurance scam.

540
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:14,773
Crashed cars into drivers
and submitted phony claims.

541
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:19,069
Yeah, whiplash is easy to fake.
You just get a sketchy doctor to go along.

542
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:21,446
But young Nicky's take
would've been pretty slim.

543
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,531
So what?

544
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:25,868
I'm just trying to understand how he had
enough money to buy tacky diamond earrings

545
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:29,788
- and boats.
- And missing watches.

546
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:31,456
Yeah.

547
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:34,459
God, I gotta know
what happened to this clown.

548
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:36,795
You know I checked up on you.

549
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,633
Used to be homicide. Miami.

550
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:43,010
Guilty as charged.

551
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:46,263
- So, what happened?
- It's a story for another time.

552
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:49,308
It's fine. I like working in the Keys
when I'm working.

553
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,643
I'm actually currently suspended.

554
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:54,938
That's a story for another time,
after the previous story for another time.

555
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:59,860
Right now, I'm just pretty much focused
on, you know, moving down the ladder

556
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:01,486
just as quickly as possible.

557
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,116
- Thanks for cheering me up.
- Yeah.

558
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:09,870
Another time could be now,
if you're hungry? Wanna grab lunch?

559
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:12,956
I'm seeing someone.

560
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:15,751
Cool. That's great news.

561
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:19,254
I was more talking like just
if you were interested in

562
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:20,881
why I got demoted so many times,

563
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,591
but-- Is he a big guy?

564
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,301
Sniper. For the SWAT.

565
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,930
Yes, well, size doesn't really matter
if you're shooting people.

566
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:31,892
It's just the darkness you have
to live with-- Thank you, Dr. Campesino.

567
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:34,061
I am very grateful. Nice touch.

568
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:41,443
<i>Up until now, Neville had lived
a fairly stress-free life.</i>

569
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:46,323
<i>Driggs would never admit it,
but he was pretty damned happy too.</i>

570
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:51,703
<i>Still, the thought of losing his house was
more than a wake-up call.</i>

571
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:54,706
<i>It was like a lit firecracker up his butt.</i>

572
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:59,253
<i>And let's face it,
even with an easygoing guy like Neville,</i>

573
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:03,215
<i>you can only push a man so far
before he decides to fight back.</i>

574
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:13,892
Brother. What the fuck are you doing?

575
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:15,686
Peeing in a gas tank.

576
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:19,565
Sorry, Willy,
didn't know you were driving this one.

577
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:22,150
Never mind to me,
I get paid the same. After we done here,

578
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:25,153
we're supposed to work our way down
the beach and take down your house.

579
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:26,530
I figured.

580
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:30,450
You want help?

581
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:33,745
Yeah.

582
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:41,128
What the fuck?

583
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:47,134
<i>Oh, Yancy, why aren't
you answering the goddamn phone?</i>

584
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:49,636
<i>Look, just come by the station
when you're back.</i>

585
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,346
<i>Yancy spent the rest of the drive</i>

586
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,473
<i>convincing himself
that this was good news.</i>

587
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:59,688
Why does Sonny wanna talk to me?
What'd I do?

588
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:01,815
- You know what you did.
- No, I don't.

589
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:03,609
Sonny checked in with Mrs. Stripling,

590
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:06,778
and she bitched about you asking
all sorts of questions.

591
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:09,489
That. Yeah.
Now it's starting to come back to me.

592
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:12,117
And then the assistant coroner
in Miami called.

593
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:16,914
Said you went back there sniffing around
about a potential homicide.

594
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,791
Rosa told on me? Oh, man, I liked her.

595
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:22,377
Now, Sonny's all pissed,
like seriously pissed.

596
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:25,839
Oh, come on, Ro, I'm already suspended.
How bad could it be?

597
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,887
I can't have you running roughshod
all over the motherfucking place!

598
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,388
You understand me, boy?

599
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:41,396
<i>I guess the good news was
that Yancy wasn't suspended anymore.</i>

600
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:43,941
<i>He was fired.</i>

601
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:52,115
<i>They didn't let him keep anything,
certainly not his dignity.</i>

602
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,577
<i>Hell, he was lucky he had a ride home.</i>

603
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:37,786
So you do check your messages?

604
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,871
I talked to Cliff.

605
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:42,833
Guess we turned the page
on me being a potential serial killer.

606
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,251
Gonna miss that.

607
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,464
You know, he is just such a stubborn,
old, limp dick.

608
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:52,384
Look, he just wants to see you punished.

609
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:54,636
Can't you just say you don't want a trial

610
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,014
and you'll accept whatever consequences
he sees fit?

611
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:58,765
Just say whatever he decides?

612
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:02,311
I don't have the best legal mind, but that
seems like giving him a lot of leverage.

613
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:03,687
Andrew.

614
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,191
This isn't how problems get solved.
Take your time. I'll be with you in five.

615
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:10,903
Coming now.

616
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:14,865
You know, I can't have a trial, Andrew.

617
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:20,495
If certain things came out,
it would ruin my life.

618
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:22,831
For fuck's sake.

619
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:24,875
What does Cliff have on you?

620
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,168
What did you do?

621
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:30,255
You love to be the hero, so here you go.

622
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:32,966
Take the bullet for me.

623
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:36,220
Like Frederic in <i>Farewell to Arms</i>.

624
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,766
You actually read one of the books
I gave you?

625
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:42,351
My TV was broken.

626
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:44,394
Andrew, this moment?

627
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:48,482
This is the most I'd ever wished
you knew my real name.

628
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:54,696
Babe, for future reference,
I already find women so confusing.

629
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:57,616
You don't have to bother with fake names.

630
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:00,994
- God.
- <i>And then,</i>

631
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:02,538
<i>for the thousandth time,</i>

632
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:06,500
<i>Yancy said goodbye forever
to his future former girlfriend.</i>

633
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,253
Wow, you guys are quite the team!

634
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,380
Raccoon on a shovel,
you know I could've done that.

635
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:13,340
You're going to have to split the tip
both ways.

636
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:15,092
I'm just kidding.
I'm not tipping anything.

637
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:22,599
Man, I can still smell that dead raccoon

638
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,686
or maybe it's just the odor
from the way the house looks.

639
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:28,522
Hey, any idea why
they're making me swap out

640
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:30,232
all my outdoor lights for these red ones?

641
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:31,483
Yeah, the baby turtles.

642
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:33,277
Who gives a fuck about baby turtles?

643
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,904
You know, I think mom and dad turtles do
and also me.

644
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:38,949
Hey, what's with the pimp suit?
You got a hot date?

645
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:41,451
Going to a funeral.
Should be a lot of fun.

646
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:46,582
<i>Seeing as he lost his badge
a couple hours ago,</i>

647
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:51,086
<i>Yancy knew the last place he should be was
Nick Stripling's funeral snooping around.</i>

648
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:53,797
<i>And yet, there he was.</i>

649
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:00,512
The cemetery…

650
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:03,515
Hi, sweetie.

651
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,143
You know it's a funeral, right?
Because I can see your vagina.

652
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,187
Fuck off.

653
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,396
- Hi, Simon.
- Hey.

654
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:11,315
- I like your hat.
- Thank you.

655
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:13,192
Thank you, Father.

656
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:16,278
If you could keep it kind of tight,
just don't ramble too much, okay?

657
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:17,487
God bless you, Father.

658
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:22,367
Let us pray.

659
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,871
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.

660
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:28,415
Thank you, Denise.

661
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:32,294
- Aw, of course.
- Thank you. Thank you.

662
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:34,546
- This was wonderful.
- Tell Chad bye.

663
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:38,467
You gentlemen look
like you're barely holding it together.

664
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,969
- Friends of the deceased?
- Thanks so much for coming. Yeah.

665
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:43,013
You guys are definitely feds.

666
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:44,681
Why are you so interested
in the Striplings?

667
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:45,974
Don't be an asshole.

668
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:48,435
That's bad luck
to swear at a cemetery, guy.

669
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,062
Or is it to blow each other
at the cemetery?

670
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:51,271
I keep forgetting which one.

671
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:55,400
Really? No banter?
I thought we were gonna banter.

672
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:57,986
Take your ball and go home? Okay.

673
00:37:58,529 --> 00:37:59,613
He'll see the light.

674
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:04,868
So don't cry for him,
'cause he's in the trees. He's in the air.

675
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:19,883
I'm sorry for your loss.

676
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:22,719
Were you a friend of my dad's?

677
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:25,973
I'm Detective Yancy, I'm--
I mean, I was, I--

678
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:30,269
I was in charge of your father's remains,

679
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:35,816
and I just wanted to be available in case
any of the family had any questions.

680
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:37,776
Great hat, by the way.

681
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:41,989
<i>Out of respect,</i>

682
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:45,033
<i>Caitlin had vowed to stay
until they put her dad in the ground.</i>

683
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:48,412
What the fuck?

684
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:52,457
Well, they can't shovel the dirt on
until all the mourners leave.

685
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:56,253
I actually don't know if that's true.
I just made that up.

686
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:58,422
Let's go, Simon.

687
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,682
Look at that, I was right.
What do you know.

688
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:09,975
I actually do have a question.

689
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:13,645
We peeked at the funeral home
and dad's arm,

690
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:15,314
- it just--
- It's just random rigor mortis.

691
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:18,942
- What are you talking about?
- Right, they probably fixed that.

692
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:21,278
She means the wedding ring.
Tell him, sweetheart.

693
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:25,824
Eve switched it out. It was platinum,
now it's 14-karat yellow gold.

694
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:29,077
Maybe, I don't know.
But, is that legal? Stealing his ring?

695
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:31,038
Well, as his wife, she's entitled.

696
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,498
But if you're upset about it,
why not just talk to Eve about it?

697
00:39:33,582 --> 00:39:37,419
She hates me and I hate her.
She's a fucking skank.

698
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:38,670
Sweetheart, please.

699
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:41,882
Simon, go to the car. Go to the car.

700
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:47,221
Wow, impressive.

701
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:49,723
Are you still on the case or what, dude?

702
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:52,184
Well, there is no case
unless some new information turns up.

703
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:53,894
There's not much else to be done.

704
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:56,063
Eve killed my dad.

705
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:59,316
She 100% murdered my father.

706
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:04,321
What makes you think so?
Did he say something? Was he unhappy?

707
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:06,365
How the fuck would I know if he was happy?

708
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:08,534
I haven't talked to that asshole
in over a year.

709
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:19,169
<i>Neville wasn't sure
what he was supposed to do either,</i>

710
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:21,755
<i>but he knew one thing that always helped.</i>

711
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,383
Here you go, boss man. Drink up.

712
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:26,844
Neville!

713
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:30,430
Why you don't come
to the bar last night, boy?

714
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:31,890
I was over at Tanny's house.

715
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:35,477
She thinks I'm rich now, so that's nice.

716
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:36,478
Very nice.

717
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:39,565
All right, drinks on me

718
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:42,192
if you fellas can help me figure out
how to keep them from taking my home.

719
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:44,778
- You got any ideas?
- I got one.

720
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:47,114
- Besides peeing in gas tanks.
- Then, no.

721
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:50,117
Come on now, think.

722
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,833
Maybe for now we just drink on it.

723
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:58,959
- Yeah.
- Ay.

724
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:00,043
Ay.

725
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,217
Hey.

726
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:10,804
Spent all my money on drinks
for you fools.

727
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,097
You still give me no ideas.

728
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:14,016
Yeah, we are bad investments.

729
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:17,644
Do you believe in Obeah?

730
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:20,856
Obeah. What are you talking about,
that voodoo shit? Come on now.

731
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:24,067
No different than paying a psychic
to tell you what's what.

732
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:27,404
Hell, no sillier than them tall tales
them tell you in the Bible.

733
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:28,488
Watch your mouth.

734
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:33,285
Me just saying, maybe one day
you go visit the Dragon Queen.

735
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,829
<i>Since they were kids,</i>

736
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:38,665
<i>Neville and his friends had heard
terrifying stories</i>

737
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:43,128
<i>about the Dragon Queen
and all her magical powers.</i>

738
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:45,339
It's here she live.

739
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:47,508
Her family have been on this island
for years.

740
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:51,803
- I don't know.
- You're scared of her.

741
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:53,180
- No.
- I'm scared of her.

742
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:56,141
As you should be, boy.
That scary witch is a man-eater.

743
00:41:56,225 --> 00:41:59,561
Story says her last three boyfriends,
all young and healthy…

744
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:03,524
they're all dead.

745
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:15,285
Not funny!

746
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:22,584
<i>It should be pretty clear by now,</i>

747
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:25,546
<i>Yancy was not great at letting things go.</i>

748
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:00,873
- All right. What do I owe ya?
- For a fucked up job like this?

749
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,251
- 300.
- I could probably swing 250.

750
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,961
All right, 250.

751
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:08,839
But when the guy freaks and wants it
removed, make sure he calls me.

752
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:11,592
Miguel, who else is he gonna call?
You got a terrific Yelp score.

753
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:14,136
You're the top beekeeper from here
all the way to the Redlands.

754
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:16,930
- Yeah.
- Now, when the owner does call,

755
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:18,891
maybe you can't get over here right away.

756
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:20,976
All right,
it's gonna cost you an extra 20.

757
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:22,978
You gotta stop with the negotiating.
We're done.

758
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:24,813
I'll throw in the rest of this joint.

759
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,025
Excellent weed, officer.
It's called Trainwreck.

760
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,485
- It's called what?
- Trainwreck.

761
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:33,614
Deal. Gimme a ride to town,
I'll buy you dinner?

762
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:35,824
- And drinks?
- Miguel. We're done.

763
00:44:09,316 --> 00:44:10,859
Fucknuts.

764
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:14,905
<i>I felt bad about laughing,
so I apologized the way men should.</i>

765
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,615
- There you go.
- Thank you.

766
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:20,285
You know what kind of shark lost these?

767
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,871
Bonnethead.

768
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:25,249
Or baby lemon, maybe.

769
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:26,875
Yeah, that's what I thought too.

770
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:28,043
Where'd you get 'em?

771
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:30,337
They were pulled out of that arm
that you snagged

772
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,714
and, well,
bonnetheads hang out in the shallows.

773
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:36,885
And victim's boat supposedly sank
in deep water.

774
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:40,681
Plus, I've never seen a bonnethead
that can twist a man's arm off.

775
00:44:40,764 --> 00:44:42,766
No. It's not possible.

776
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:48,355
So our bigger problem, Andrew,
is that was my last beer.

777
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:50,107
You wanna walk me up to the Half Shell?

778
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,985
Yeah. Will you order me one?
I'm gonna be with you shortly.

779
00:44:53,068 --> 00:44:54,361
Yeah. Have fun.

780
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:57,239
I'm okay, I'll get it myself.
Thanks so much.

781
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:05,581
Your father built this place, yeah?

782
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,168
As a fishing shack.

783
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:11,336
I moved in when he passed.

784
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:16,800
Can't imagine it being gone.

785
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:18,969
Then go talk to the Dragon Queen.

786
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:20,762
You really believe in that stuff?

787
00:45:21,722 --> 00:45:22,723
Maybe.

788
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:27,019
My mother sure did.

789
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:28,896
My mom surely did not.

790
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:31,690
Besides, Obeah is illegal here anyway.

791
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:35,152
So is smoking weed.
And that not seem to bother you at all.

792
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:37,946
Look,

793
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,868
if you don't try everything,
you gonna regret it.

794
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:51,877
Okay.

795
00:45:53,212 --> 00:45:55,797
Just don't cross her.

796
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:59,593
They say she can bewitch
the strongest of men.

797
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:03,805
So you'll probably be fine, man.

798
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,183
If I end up dead,

799
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:09,269
- my ghost is coming for you.
- Good, man. I get lonely.

800
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:14,942
Hey, she pricey, so bring money.
Got to be wrapped in brown paper.

801
00:46:15,526 --> 00:46:17,486
And a bottle of booze as an offering.

802
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:21,532
And you're gonna need
a piece of the developer man clothing.

803
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:24,284
<i>Apparently, the Dragon Queen needed</i>

804
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:26,745
<i>something that had actually touched
the developer's skin</i>

805
00:46:26,828 --> 00:46:28,914
<i>in order to make a really good curse.</i>

806
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:31,124
<i>And whether or not Neville believed</i>

807
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,626
<i>in any of that crap,</i>

808
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:34,670
<i>he thought
he might as well cover his bases.</i>

809
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:14,209
Good monkey.

810
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:19,214
<i>That night, Driggs got
all the grapes he wanted and a cold beer.</i>

811
00:47:19,715 --> 00:47:20,632
<i>He had earned it.</i>

812
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:25,637
<i>So, grab your sunscreen and your shades
'cause tomorrow is all sunny skies.</i>

813
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:29,266
<i>I'm Heather with the Weather,
and that's the weather.</i>

814
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:31,935
She's been getting it wrong for years.

815
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:33,353
Still a smokeshow.

816
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:34,438
Hell yeah.

817
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:38,775
These are from the gentleman over there.

818
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:42,321
Who's your buddy?

819
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:46,450
That's Phinney, used to mate for me.

820
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:50,829
In fact, he is the one who actually
pulled the arm out of the water.

821
00:47:50,913 --> 00:47:52,247
Did he now?

822
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:53,373
Yep.

823
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:54,791
So a few days ago,

824
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:58,629
I gave him some grief for not hosing off
the tackle, and he quit.

825
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:01,298
He said he did not need
my bullshit anymore.

826
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:03,425
Now he's sending you beers and oysters?

827
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:07,137
Hey, he's just showing off.
Said he came into some serious dough.

828
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:10,516
- How?
- Fuck if I know.

829
00:48:20,275 --> 00:48:22,778
Guys, I am so sorry to interrupt you two,

830
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:25,489
but I have been scouring this place
looking for the Pussy Magnet.

831
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:26,657
Have either of you seen him?

832
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:29,743
- Here I am.
- Yeah.

833
00:48:29,826 --> 00:48:32,454
You know, it's a great necklace
'cause it says who you are immediately.

834
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:34,164
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- Right?

835
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:36,542
- Yeah.
- What do you want?

836
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:38,544
Just to say thank you for the beers.

837
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:41,338
Well, they were for him,
and you were just there, so…

838
00:48:41,922 --> 00:48:44,550
Hey, I heard you were on the boat
for that whole weird arm thing.

839
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:46,301
I've never heard of anything like that.

840
00:48:46,802 --> 00:48:48,262
Yeah, well, it happened.

841
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:51,014
I have a question and tell me
if it's none of my business.

842
00:48:51,098 --> 00:48:55,227
How does an unemployed half-wit like you
get the bank to buy bling and oysters?

843
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:07,781
Are you a cop?

844
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:10,075
I'm sorry,
I didn't think he was gonna leave.

845
00:49:10,158 --> 00:49:11,827
Probably can't leave him out there
by himself

846
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,537
'cause all the girls are gonna swarm him.

847
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,040
Are you done with these fries?
I'm gonna go see what the Magnet's up to.

848
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:30,012
The fuck you want?

849
00:49:36,935 --> 00:49:38,187
Fucknuts.

850
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:58,123
<i>On any other day, if you had asked Neville</i>

851
00:49:58,207 --> 00:50:01,335
<i>whether he believed in the Dragon Queen
and all her powers,</i>

852
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,795
<i>he'd have laughed and said no.</i>

853
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:09,885
It open.

854
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,347
<i>But being there in person…</i>

855
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:17,601
<i>it just felt a little different.</i>

856
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:32,074
One of y'all need to talk.

857
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:41,917
I need some Obeah.

858
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:43,669
A curse.

859
00:50:44,837 --> 00:50:46,171
Not sure how it works.

860
00:50:46,255 --> 00:50:47,589
Sit down then.

861
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:50,133
Ya-Ya…

862
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:53,637
leave us please.

863
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,847
I gotta work.

864
00:51:01,812 --> 00:51:03,397
Anytime you're ready, Ya-Ya.

865
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:09,486
I make the tea.

866
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:30,174
So talk.

867
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:33,177
Who this devil is you wanna get rid of?

868
00:51:33,886 --> 00:51:36,889
He's a developer,
goes by the name Christopher.

869
00:51:38,265 --> 00:51:41,185
My friend Willy tells me he's supposed
to be flying back here tonight.

870
00:51:41,894 --> 00:51:43,770
Then time is of the essence.

871
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:47,149
- You bring money?
- Yeah.

872
00:51:54,406 --> 00:51:55,699
This is also for you.

873
00:51:57,492 --> 00:51:59,286
Someone set you straight.

874
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:02,456
You got anything belonging to this man?

875
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:12,299
He ain't Bahamian.

876
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:15,010
That's true. He from the States.

877
00:52:15,594 --> 00:52:18,597
Then the magic gotta be extra strong.

878
00:52:21,934 --> 00:52:22,935
You know…

879
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:27,397
if I go and do this thing for you…

880
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:31,735
he might go and die.

881
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:38,200
Whatever God's will.

882
00:52:45,874 --> 00:52:47,251
Look at you.

883
00:52:48,126 --> 00:52:51,004
Jumping in with both feet.

884
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:54,883
All right then.

885
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:02,015
Maybe next time you visit,

886
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:05,561
you stay a bit and keep me company.

887
00:53:06,812 --> 00:53:10,816
Just you though, no monkey.

888
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:16,238
Maybe we can have
a couple rums together, you and me.

889
00:53:22,703 --> 00:53:24,037
But not tonight.

890
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:32,087
What you doing? Go!

891
00:53:32,171 --> 00:53:33,422
Okay.

892
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:49,354
<i>For some reason,
all Madeline could think about was how</i>

893
00:53:49,438 --> 00:53:51,773
<i>Phinney had let her choose
the restaurant tonight.</i>

894
00:53:52,482 --> 00:53:53,901
You all right?

895
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:55,319
No, man.

896
00:53:57,779 --> 00:54:01,575
You know, I always wondered what's up
with these red street lights everywhere.

897
00:54:02,284 --> 00:54:03,619
They're for the baby turtles.

898
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:09,499
When they hatch they can mistake the white
lights for the moon and go the wrong way.

899
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:15,339
Jesus Christ,
you think he's gonna be okay?

900
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:18,050
Unfortunately, I think it's just for show.

901
00:54:20,677 --> 00:54:21,678
I'm really sorry.

902
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:31,230
<i>I know it probably feels like
we're coming to the end of this story,</i>

903
00:54:31,313 --> 00:54:33,398
<i>but it's really just the beginning.</i>

904
00:54:34,191 --> 00:54:35,984
But you never answered. Are you a cop?

905
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:37,945
I'm on sabbatical.

906
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:41,365
You're gonna have to answer
a lot of questions.

907
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:44,993
Hopefully, you can keep me out of it
as much as possible.

908
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:46,995
But afterwards,

909
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:52,000
maybe you and I can talk and try
to figure out who killed your boyfriend.

910
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:56,296
<i>Remember how annoying it was
when I stopped telling Yancy's story</i>

911
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,091
<i>and kept jumping over to Neville's,
and I told you to be patient?</i>

912
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:01,385
No. Bad monkey. Bad monkey.

913
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:05,556
<i>I've been telling stories
to dumb tourists for years.</i>

914
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:11,019
<i>I'm not calling you dumb,
but I knew exactly what I was doing.</i>

915
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:18,443
<i>Because as Neville watched that developer,
Christopher, wade into shore,</i>

916
00:55:19,653 --> 00:55:22,155
<i>I'm hoping it's finally pretty clear.</i>

917
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:26,952
<i>I wasn't telling two stories.</i>

918
00:55:28,453 --> 00:55:30,581
<i>I was telling one.</i>
