1
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,080
Mr. Soprano?

2
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,707
Yeah.

3
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,886
Have a seat.

4
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,211
My understanding from Dr. Cusamano,
your physician...

5
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,088
...is that you collapsed.

6
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:55,092
Possibly a panic attack?
You were unable to breathe?

7
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,220
They said it was a panic attack.

8
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,849
The blood and neurological
work came back negative.

9
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:05,436
And they sent me here.

10
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,730
You don't agree that
you had a panic attack?

11
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,110
How are you feeling now?

12
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,361
Good.

13
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,239
Fine. Back at work.

14
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,784
What line of work are you in?

15
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,245
Waste management consultant.

16
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:33,464
It's impossible for me to
talk to a psychiatrist.

17
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:38,010
Any thoughts at all
on why you blacked out?

18
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,806
I don't know. Stress, maybe.

19
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,809
About what?

20
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,944
<i>I don't know.</i>

21
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,989
<i>The morning I got sick,
I'd been thinking.</i>

22
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,161
<i>It's good to be in something
from the ground floor.</i>

23
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,498
<i>And I came too late for that, I know.</i>

24
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:11,794
<i>But lately, I'm getting the feeling
that I came in at the end.</i>

25
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,420
<i>The best is over.</i>

26
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,840
<i>Many Americans, I think,
feel that way.</i>

27
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,551
<i>I think about my father.</i>

28
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,221
<i>He never reached the heights like me.</i>

29
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,348
<i>In a lot of ways he had it better.</i>

30
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,936
<i>He had his people, they had
their standards, they had pride.</i>

31
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,813
<i>Today, what do we got?</i>

32
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:40,197
Did you have these feelings of loss
more acutely before you collapsed?

33
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,075
I don't know.

34
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:04,263
<i>A couple months before, these
two ducks landed in my pool.</i>

35
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:08,559
<i>It was amazing. They're from Canada,
and it was mating season.</i>

36
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,687
<i>They had some ducklings.</i>

37
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,901
Come on, get some bread.

38
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,996
<i>My daughter's friend was there
to drive her to school.</i>

39
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:33,584
- Meadow, your father with those ducks.
- The yard smells like duck poo.

40
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,795
You gotta have more than
just juice for breakfast.

41
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:41,258
You need brain food for school.
Happy birthday, handsome.

42
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,802
- Thirteen.
- He doesn't act it.

43
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:47,765
The male and female duck made
a home in your pool and did it?

44
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,517
Get out of here! You're so gross!

45
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:53,103
You want some of
last night's <i>sfogliatelle?</i>

46
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,148
- Get out of here with that fat.
- One bite.

47
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,108
How do you stay skinny,
Mrs. Soprano?

48
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,947
Him, with those ducks.

49
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:08,118
If you don't like that ramp, I'll
build another. Maybe it's the wood.

50
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,630
Look, they're trying to fly.

51
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,176
<i>- National Geographic,</i> Dad.
- Yeah, super.

52
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,137
- You showed us yesterday.
- This is great!

53
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:31,809
Now my wife feels
this friend is a bad influence.

54
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,145
It's so cool you're coming to Aspen
with my family at Christmas.

55
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:39,858
Last year I saw Skeet Ulrich,
as close as from where you're sitting.

56
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,985
Miss Meadow, we made a deal.

57
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:46,824
Keep your grades up and your curfew
until Christmas, then you get to go.

58
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,659
I know that.

59
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:49,952
Good morning.

60
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,371
- Hey, Mr. Soprano.
- We're late, Dad.

61
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,873
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, Dad.

62
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,176
You're gonna be home tonight for
Anthony Jr.'s birthday party, right?

63
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,347
Birdman, hello!

64
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,225
Yeah, yeah.
I'll get home early from work.

65
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,186
I'm not talking about work.

66
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,859
This won't work.
I can't talk about my personal life.

67
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,028
Finish telling me
about the day you collapsed.

68
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,661
<i>I drove to work with my nephew.
He's learning the business.</i>

69
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,372
<i>He's an example of what
I was talking about before.</i>

70
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:39,918
Did you call Triborough Towers
about the hauling contract?

71
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,881
I got home too late.
I didn't want to wake the man up.

72
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,719
Did you get up early and call?
He's always in his office by 6.

73
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,890
I was nauseous. My mother told me
I shouldn't even come in today.

74
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:57,060
<i>Bear in mind, this is a kid who
just bought himself a $60,000 Lexus.</i>

75
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,028
- There's that guy Mahaffey.
- Get out.

76
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,739
Right there.
Next to the boo-boo in pink.

77
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,408
Back up.

78
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:26,924
My friend Mahaffey
pulling his taffy. Hello.

79
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,800
<i>We saw this guy.</i>

80
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,220
There was an outstanding loan.

81
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,596
One second.

82
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,100
I don't know
where this story is going.

83
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:42,564
But there are a few ethical ground
rules we should get out of the way.

84
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,276
What you tell me here...

85
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,780
...falls under
doctor/patient confidentiality.

86
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,615
Except if I was...

87
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:56,912
If I was to hear, let's say,
a murder was to take place...

88
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,122
Not that it would, but if.

89
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:03,293
If a patient tells me a story
where someone's going to get hurt...

90
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,463
...I'm supposed to go
to the authorities.

91
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,966
Technically.

92
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,305
You said you were in waste management.

93
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,140
The environment.

94
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,227
Dr. Cusamano, besides
being your family physician...

95
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,980
...is also your next-door neighbor.

96
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,648
See what I'm saying?

97
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,235
I don't know what happened
with this fellow, I'm...

98
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,279
I'm just saying.

99
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,365
Nothing.

100
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,659
We had coffee.

101
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,744
Alex!

102
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:39,329
Help!

103
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,005
Security! Help!

104
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,965
Oh, shit.

105
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:10,694
Asshole!

106
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,199
Tony!

107
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,868
Wait up!

108
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,917
Security!

109
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,110
You all right?

110
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,738
My leg is broken.
The bone's coming through.

111
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,073
Let me see.

112
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,826
I'll give you a fucking bone,
you prick! Where's my fucking money?

113
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,245
So you had coffee.

114
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:03,914
Right.

115
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,833
You son of a bitch, motherfucker.

116
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:15,592
- What are you doing? Get over here!
- That's $3000 here. $3000.

117
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:16,885
Go ahead.

118
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,640
Where's the fucking money?

119
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,266
I'll get the money!

120
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:24,768
I know you will.

121
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,271
You should get a cork in your mouth
because you say I'm nothing...

122
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:31,274
...compared to the people
who used to run things. Prick.

123
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,276
I'm nothing.

124
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,784
Shut up.

125
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,122
What are you crying about? HMO.
You're covered.

126
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,082
You prick.

127
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,128
Degenerate fucking gambler.

128
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:52,879
<i>Go on.</i>

129
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,631
<i>Next, I had a meeting.</i>

130
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,427
<i>I was called in to consult by
a garbage-hauling company I represent.</i>

131
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,637
What's the story
with Triborough Towers?

132
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:05,642
The manager wants the contract
with Dick, but this Kolar Sanitation...

133
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,811
Another nationwide company.

134
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:11,815
The Kolar brothers. Czechoslovakian
immigrants or some shit.

135
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:15,026
These Polacks will haul
paper, plastic and aluminum...

136
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,945
...for 7000 a month less than Dick.

137
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,823
They pay us 40 times the monthly
for stealing a stop.

138
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,616
That's the thing. They won't.

139
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:26,329
Says if he can tell the commie bosses
in Czechoslovakia to fuck off...

140
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,331
...he can fucking tell us.

141
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,126
- I give up.
- Fucking garbage business.

142
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,545
Yeah, I know. It's all changing.

143
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,505
Let me see what I can do.

144
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,341
Sure? You over your stomachache?

145
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,510
- Oh, yeah.
- Good.

146
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,430
What are you doing here?

147
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,725
Gabriella sends me
down here for the <i>capocollo.</i>

148
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,436
Hey, T, let me ask you something.

149
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,981
Didn't you used to go to school
with Artie Bucco?

150
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,067
A situation came up.
It involves my uncle.

151
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,487
I can't go into details.

152
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,696
That's fine.

153
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:04,034
But I will say this. My uncle
adds to my general stress level.

154
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,703
It's none of my business...

155
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,831
...but down at the club,
the word is...

156
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,043
...your Uncle Junior
is gonna whack Pussy Malanga.

157
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,882
He's gonna do it
at Artie Bucco's restaurant.

158
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,520
Hey, boys. How are you?

159
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,065
Don't move.

160
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,734
- Uncle Junior, how you doing?
- Hey.

161
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,986
Hey, good to see you.

162
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,738
Hi there, Chris.

163
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,076
I was talking about you. It's Anthony
Jr.'s birthday tonight, right?

164
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:50,914
Don't buy him anything big,
we overindulge him. Okay?

165
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,583
Hey!

166
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,545
- Artie, how's your rash?
- It's itchy.

167
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:57,796
Come here.

168
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:02,050
- Good to see you. You'll come over?
- Yeah, have a seat.

169
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,140
You know what it means, one of
these mutts gets wet in here?

170
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,601
It'll ruin his business.

171
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,062
You better sit down with your uncle.

172
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,651
<i>Uncle Junior's my father's brother.</i>

173
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,737
<i>A good guy, just getting old, cranky.</i>

174
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,617
<i>He used to take me to Yankee games
when I was a kid.</i>

175
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,619
<i>I love my uncle.</i>

176
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,623
<i>At the same time, when I was young...</i>

177
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,627
<i>...he told my girl cousins
I would never be a varsity athlete.</i>

178
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,755
<i>Frankly, that was a tremendous blow
to my self-esteem.</i>

179
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,363
Who's there?

180
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,823
It's me, Ma.

181
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,492
Who are you?

182
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,995
Ma, open the door.

183
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:19,127
- Anthony?
- Yeah, it's me. Open the door.

184
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,592
Hi, how are you?

185
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,679
Jeez, Ma. Get some air in here.

186
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,390
Did you lock the door?

187
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:36,019
- Yeah, I did.
- Somebody called here last night.

188
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,396
- After dark.
- Who?

189
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,232
You think I'd answer?
It was dark out.

190
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,360
Ma, I'll never understand that.

191
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,862
The phone is auditory.
Dark is an eye thing.

192
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:49,491
I could understand not going out.
You could get jumped.

193
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:50,867
But the phone?

194
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:55,830
Listen to him, he knows everything.
You want some lunch? I got eggplant.

195
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,376
No, no, I just ate.
Know who I just ran into?

196
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,543
Uncle Jun.

197
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:05,632
Oh, that one. You think he ever
comes to see his sister-in-law?

198
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,134
Remember Artie Bucco?

199
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,387
Kid I went to elementary school with?

200
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:14,182
Oh, yeah, I still see his mother.

201
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,435
She tells me...

202
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:21,022
...he calls her every day.

203
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,567
Well, Uncle Junior's gonna
make a problem for Artie.

204
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,194
Could affect his livelihood.

205
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:29,197
- What's that?
- CD player.

206
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,282
For who?

207
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,742
For me?

208
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,036
- I don't want it.
- You don't want it.

209
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:39,249
You love music, all the old stuff's
on CD. Your favorites.

210
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,584
"Pajama Game," Connie Francis.

211
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:42,919
Here.

212
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,757
Come on.

213
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,093
Move around a bit.
It's good for you.

214
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,387
What? No.

215
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:56,099
- Come on. Come on.
- Stop it.

216
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:01,813
You need to occupy your mind. When
Dad died, you were gonna do things.

217
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:05,942
- He was a saint.
- I know he was. But he's gone.

218
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,070
You were gonna travel, volunteer.
You've done nothing.

219
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,282
Stop telling me how to live my life.
Just shut up.

220
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,284
I just worry...

221
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,454
And don't start with that
nursing home business again.

222
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,499
It's not a nursing home,
it's a retirement community!

223
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,420
You interact with seniors
your own age, go places, do things!

224
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,006
I've seen women in nursing homes...

225
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,967
...in these wheelchairs,
babbling like idiots!

226
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,969
Here, eat your eggplant.

227
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,305
I told you, I already ate lunch.

228
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,310
All right, listen.

229
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:44,272
You just speak to Uncle Junior
about Artie, okay?

230
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,316
He respects you.
He'll listen to you.

231
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:51,321
If your uncle has business with Arthur,
he knows what he's doing.

232
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:55,950
And I don't?

233
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,747
Well, all I know is...

234
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,875
...daughters are better at taking care
of their mothers than sons.

235
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,003
Yeah, and I bought CDs
for a broken record.

236
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,553
I expect to see you at Anthony Jr.'s
party with your baked ziti.

237
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,807
Only if I'm picked up
and I'm brought back home.

238
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,393
I don't drive
when they're predicting rain.

239
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,979
You're healthy.
It's good for you to drive.

240
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,398
Use it or lose it.
I gotta go to work.

241
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,025
Sure...

242
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,027
...run off!

243
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,698
And that night was
my son's birthday party.

244
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,701
<i>My wife invites the priest.
He's always at the house.</i>

245
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,161
- Hey, Tony.
- How you doing?

246
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,747
- You like <i>crème anglaise?</i>
- You bless it, I'll eat it.

247
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:43,915
She's not coming.

248
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,000
- Who?
- Grandma just called.

249
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,419
She started crying and hung up.

250
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,422
- She needs a purpose.
- She's tougher than you think.

251
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,092
- So, what? No fucking ziti now?
- Hey!

252
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,750
<i>At first it felt like...</i>

253
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,919
<i>...ginger ale in my skull.</i>

254
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:44,142
- Mom, Daddy just fell! Mom!
- Oh, my God. Tony!

255
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,563
Get back!

256
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,900
Daddy! Dad!

257
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,611
Anthony Jr., call 911.

258
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,920
<i>Dr. Cusamano put me in the
hospital, gave me every kind of test.</i>

259
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:23,640
Okay.

260
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,146
Hey! Carm.

261
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,945
- Thought you might want some company.
- Yeah.

262
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,490
6:30 in the morning.

263
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,120
- How are the kids?
- They're worried about you.

264
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,291
I told Anthony Jr.
We'd rain-check his birthday.

265
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,176
Think I got a brain tumor?

266
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,512
Well, we're gonna find out.

267
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,682
What a bedside manner.
Very encouraging.

268
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,558
What, are you gonna not know?

269
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,149
We had some good times.
Had some good years.

270
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,318
Here he goes with the nostalgia.

271
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,362
No marriage is perfect.

272
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,364
Having that <i>goomar</i> on the side helps.

273
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:25,201
I'm not seeing her anymore.
What about that priest?

274
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,828
Don't even go there.

275
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:30,748
Father is a spiritual mentor.
He's making me a better Catholic!

276
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,710
Well, we all got different needs.

277
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,714
What's different between us is,
you're going to hell when you die.

278
00:21:56,399 --> 00:22:00,778
<i>My nephew, Christopher, was
handling the garbage contract problem.</i>

279
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,906
<i>But on this I will also
not go into detail.</i>

280
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,633
Emil Kolar.

281
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,886
Chris Moltisanti.

282
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:28,723
Hey, in Czech Republic too,
we love pork.

283
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,808
You ever have our sausages?

284
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,605
No. I thought the only sausages
they had was Italian and Jimmy Dean's.

285
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,108
See what you learn when you
cross cultures and shit?

286
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,279
My Uncle Evzen doesn't know I came.

287
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,948
If we make any progress,
I'll tell him.

288
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:50,161
Hey, we have to make progress, Emil.
We gotta stop the madness.

289
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,331
Business is changing,
we're the younger generation.

290
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,124
We have issues in common.

291
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,919
Emil.

292
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,298
Where'd you go to high school?
Was it Poland?

293
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:04,842
I'm not Polish.

294
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:08,137
Czechoslovakian,
that's a type of Polack, right?

295
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:11,766
We came here when I was 9.
I went to West Essex.

296
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:15,144
You used to play my cousin Gregory
in football, he...

297
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:18,439
- Where's the stuff?
- Yes, yes, yes.

298
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,612
The reason for the visit.
We got it all deployed for you.

299
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,824
Taste the wares, Emil.

300
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,992
Emil.

301
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:59,397
The doctors kept me hanging
about the tests, as doctors will do.

302
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:03,359
So my uncle and I played
a round of golf and had lunch.

303
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:07,029
You keep mentioning your uncle.
What's the problem?

304
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:08,698
Who do you think you are?

305
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,160
I'm the person who says
how things go, that's who.

306
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:16,205
Artie's dinner business is nice,
upscale people from the suburbs.

307
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,832
Don't ruin his life.

308
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,877
Vesuvio is where Pussy feels safe.

309
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,629
He's been eating here all his life.

310
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,715
You kill him someplace else.

311
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:29,051
You may run North Jersey,
but you don't run your uncle!

312
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,763
How many fucking hours did I spend
playing catch with you?

313
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:40,730
<i>Can we focus more
on your immediate family?</i>

314
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:44,692
<i>My wife and daughter
were not getting along.</i>

315
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:50,281
Darn, these laser discs
are incredible!

316
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:56,078
Tony watches <i>Godfather II</i>. He says
it looks just like the movie theater.

317
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,664
Gordon Willis.
Tony prefers <i>II,</i> not <i>I?</i>

318
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,584
He likes where Vito
goes back to Sicily.

319
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:04,086
With <i>III,</i> he was like,
"What happened?"

320
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,671
Where does Tony rank <i>Goodfellas?</i>

321
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,092
What, do you have raccoons?

322
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,970
- Somebody's jimmying a window.
- What?

323
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,599
You have all these security
lights, who would try and...?

324
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:20,269
Oh, no. Jeez, Louise!

325
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:22,271
Hold it!

326
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,940
Meadow.

327
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:29,612
I noticed the glass rattles every time
I walk to the laundry room.

328
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,614
Do we have any putty?

329
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,991
Don't give me that.
You snuck out!

330
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:35,451
What's going on?

331
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,079
You locked my bedroom window
so I'd get caught.

332
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,457
Normal people thought you were
upstairs doing your homework!

333
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:45,294
You have become a master
of lying and conniving.

334
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:47,129
I know I'm grounded.

335
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:50,091
Patrick's swim meet is tomorrow,
and he needed me!

336
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,469
Grounded for this?
Oh, no, you're not grounded.

337
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:57,848
You're not going to Aspen
with Hunter Scangarelo!

338
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,642
Yes!

339
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,769
But this shit I'm telling you...

340
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:04,146
...it'll all blow over.

341
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:11,237
Didn't you admit to Dr. Cusamano
that you were feeling depressed?

342
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,500
"Melfi."

343
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,837
What part of the boot you from?

344
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,006
Dr. Melfi.

345
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,467
My father's people were from Caserta.

346
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,177
Avellino.

347
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:38,514
My mother would have loved it
if you and I got together.

348
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:50,026
Anxiety attacks are legitimate
psychiatric emergencies.

349
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,528
Suppose you were driving
and you passed out.

350
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,196
Let me tell you something.

351
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:57,533
Nowadays, everybody's gotta go
to shrinks and counselors...

352
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:01,329
...and go on <i>Sally Jessy Raphael</i>
and talk about their problems.

353
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,206
Whatever happened to Gary Cooper?

354
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,709
The strong, silent type?

355
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,377
That was an American.

356
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:11,297
He wasn't in touch
with his feelings.

357
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:15,217
They didn't realize once they got Gary
Cooper in touch with his feelings...

358
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:16,886
...they wouldn't be able
to shut him up!

359
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:20,097
So it's dysfunction this and
that! And dysfunction <i>va fangool!</i>

360
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,392
You have strong feelings about this.

361
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:27,188
I had a semester and a half
of college...

362
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:30,900
...so I understand Freud.
I understand therapy as a concept.

363
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,819
But in my world, it does not go down.

364
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,740
Could I be happier?
Yeah. Yeah. Who couldn't?

365
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,409
Do you feel depressed?

366
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,456
Do you feel depressed?

367
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:53,214
Since the ducks left...

368
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:55,716
I guess.

369
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,595
The ducks that preceded
your losing consciousness.

370
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:02,139
Let's talk about them.

371
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,906
You can't blame T for being pissed.
You should have waited.

372
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:21,617
That's the last time I show
any fucking initiative.

373
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,953
Imagine how I felt?

374
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,746
T's running down the business...

375
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:28,290
...I fucking wet a guy
to keep one of our stops.

376
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:31,961
He's not running it down.
It's just getting harder in New York.

377
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,131
One.

378
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:36,632
Two.

379
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,259
Three.

380
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,469
Come on!

381
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,305
- This is fucked up.
- What, Pussy?

382
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:47,101
The Kolar uncle is gonna find the kid
dead on one of his bins...

383
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,937
...and get out of our
fucking business? No way.

384
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:52,189
"Louis Brassi sleeps with the fishes."

385
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,609
Luca Brassi.

386
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,319
- Luca.
- Whatever.

387
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,406
There's differences, Christopher.

388
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,325
From the Luca Brassi situation
and this?

389
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:09,206
Look, if the Kolars know the kid is
dead, it hardens their position.

390
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:13,127
Plus, now the cops are looking
for a fucking murderer.

391
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,670
What do you want to do?

392
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:18,007
He disappears.
He never comes home.

393
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,342
They know, but they don't know.

394
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,929
They hope maybe he'll turn up... if.

395
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,641
Come on. Let's get him.

396
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,477
Got him?

397
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,229
Take him to Staten Island,
I'll cut him up.

398
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,858
Pussy, you know, with T
collapsing at the birthday...

399
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:39,987
...what would you do
if he was, like, disabled?

400
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:41,989
Why would you even ask that?

401
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,702
Our lecture series in action.

402
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,746
Someone from the university
discussing...

403
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:52,249
...the novels of, I believe,
Zora Neale Hurston.

404
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,670
Didn't you just read her
in school, Med?

405
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,381
It's very nice.

406
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,723
You know, Grandma,
this place is neat.

407
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,892
You should really think about it.

408
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,229
This room was renovated last year.

409
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:14,980
What goes on behind there?

410
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:18,108
Those doors lead to our nursing unit.

411
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,237
This is a nursing home!

412
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,405
This is a residence,
but just in case...

413
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:26,742
No, you're not getting me
into a nursing home.

414
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,786
You're not listening
to what she's saying.

415
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:31,288
Women in wheelchairs,
babbling like idiots!

416
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,123
Ma, you're not listening.

417
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:36,377
You think you're so high and mighty,
don't you?

418
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,088
With your fancy office.

419
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:42,550
Anthony, people come here to die!

420
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:51,267
Oh, my God! Somebody get a doctor.

421
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:04,113
So you've come back for help.
Don't look at that as a defeat.

422
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,324
She's one of those who grew up
during the Depression.

423
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,452
But the Depression to her
was a trip to Six Flags.

424
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,288
There's that "D" word again.

425
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,754
Stay with your mother.

426
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:28,762
Now that my father's dead,
he's a saint.

427
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:32,933
When he was alive, nothing.

428
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:40,649
My dad was tough, he ran his own crew.

429
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:45,446
A guy like that and my mother
wore him down to a little nub.

430
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,782
He was a squeaking little gerbil
when he died.

431
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:53,662
Quite a formidable maternal presence.

432
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:02,504
I gotta be honest. I'm not getting
any satisfaction from my work, either.

433
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,006
Why?

434
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:07,343
Well, because of RICO.

435
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,804
- Is he your brother?
- No. The RICO Statutes.

436
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,348
Oh, of course, right.

437
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:13,515
You read the papers?

438
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,851
You know, the government's using
electronic surveillance...

439
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:20,606
...and various legal strategies
to squeeze my business.

440
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:28,155
Do you have any qualms about
how you actually make a living?

441
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,741
Yeah.

442
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:35,245
I find I have to be the sad clown.

443
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,624
Laughing on the outside...

444
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,501
...crying on the inside.

445
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,212
See, things are trending downward.

446
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,841
Used to be, a guy got pinched,
he took his prison jolt.

447
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:50,719
Everybody upheld a code of silence.

448
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:54,223
Nowadays, no values.

449
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,726
Guys today have no room
for the penal experience.

450
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:00,062
So everybody turns government witness.

451
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,944
I feel exhausted
just talking about it.

452
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:12,574
Well, with today's pharmacology,
no one needs to suffer...

453
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:16,370
...with feelings of
exhaustion and depression.

454
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:21,125
Here we go.
Here comes the Prozac.

455
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,968
Mahaffey doesn't have it.

456
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,928
What do you mean
he doesn't have it?

457
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,263
He doesn't have the money.

458
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,764
How can he not have the money?

459
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:38,267
The man does not have the money.

460
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,936
We ran the man over with the car.
T, himself.

461
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:44,481
The man has no wiggle room.
He's bled dry.

462
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,446
So...

463
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:54,241
...I hear Junior wants to
whack Pussy Bompensiero?

464
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,119
- Pussy Malanga.
- Oh, Little Pussy.

465
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,621
You think he's gonna
fuck with Big Pussy?

466
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,415
My Pussy?

467
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,459
Andrea.

468
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:08,297
Stay with drinks on the house
all night.

469
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:11,133
- Sorry, Mr. Dante.
- It's okay.

470
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:16,305
So your uncle resents
that you're the boss.

471
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:18,140
The sadness accrues.

472
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,143
Your uncle's had a hard-on
his whole life.

473
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,520
First, against your father,
his younger brother...

474
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,606
...because he was a made man
before him.

475
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,483
And now, you.

476
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:31,653
So, sure, he can't stomach
your telling him what to do.

477
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,156
Hesh, I love the man.

478
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:38,118
The man is driven <i>in toto</i>
by his insecurities.

479
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:40,621
I feel bad I was the messenger.

480
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:45,250
Your friend Artie,
with the restaurant.

481
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:47,127
Get him out of town.

482
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:51,757
That way the restaurant closes,
the hit goes down someplace else.

483
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:55,636
You old fucking Jew.

484
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,138
No wonder my old man
kept you around so long.

485
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:01,850
So what about this fucking Jew's
250 on Mahaffey's 100?

486
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,774
Mahaffey has a new business partner...

487
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,275
...you.

488
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:12,361
These HMOs pay out millions...

489
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,155
...to doctors, hospitals, whatever.

490
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:18,492
That MRI I had,
$2000 a pop.

491
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,994
Now, we give this Mahaffey a choice.

492
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:23,580
Either his company pays out
phony claims...

493
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,041
...to fake clinics we set up...

494
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,712
...or he pays Hesh
the 250 grand he owes him...

495
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,173
...which we know he cannot do.

496
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,554
Or it's a rainy night in Lyndhurst.

497
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:43,100
Very smart.
Could be major.

498
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,561
Could be as good as garbage.

499
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:49,731
- Garbage is our bread and butter.
- Was.

500
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:02,119
Miss Meadow!

501
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,540
So, Med.

502
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,251
I'm not going.

503
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:13,589
Every year, on this date,
since you were itty-bitty...

504
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:15,924
...Mom and Meadow get all dolled up...

505
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:21,096
...drive into New York Plaza Hotel
for tea under Eloise's portrait.

506
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,973
Look, where's yours?

507
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,725
I have too much homework.

508
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,102
Meadow, its our little tradition!

509
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,937
We always have so much fun!

510
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:32,441
To tell you the truth,
I felt it was dumb since I was 8!

511
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,068
I just go because you like it.

512
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:42,784
Here I thought this was something we
would do long after you got married...

513
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:44,912
...with girls of your own.

514
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,872
Hopefully I won't be
living around here by then.

515
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,124
<i>You've got mail.</i>

516
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:55,923
Meadow, you can't just lie and cheat
and break the rules you don't like!

517
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,136
What? You have something
you want to say?

518
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:06,600
Mom, do you have any idea how much
it means to go skiing in Aspen?

519
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,269
Do you think that'll
happen every year?

520
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:12,940
Like lame tea and scones
at the Plaza Hotel?

521
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:18,487
- Goodbye.
- Close my door, please.

522
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,198
Artie.

523
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:26,161
Give me a drop. Oh! A drop,
not a spurt. <i>Soave,</i> a drop!

524
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:29,790
- How are you?
- All right. Stir the meatballs.

525
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,668
- Could you help me out?
- Yeah, what do you need?

526
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,836
Cruise. Caribbean.

527
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:38,006
<i>S.S. Sagafjord,</i> 11th through the 29th.

528
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,425
Pair of tickets. I can't use them.

529
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:42,511
Can you take them off my hands?

530
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,805
- Where'd they come from?
- Comps.

531
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,224
Comps?

532
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:48,850
What does that mean?

533
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,853
As manager for the Kitchen
and Restaurant Workers Union...

534
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,482
...I administer the dental plan.
You listening to me?

535
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:59,361
A couple of dentists got together
and awarded me these tickets.

536
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:02,364
The problem is,
I can't get away those dates.

537
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:08,036
Here. When was your last vacation?

538
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,872
- Anthony, thank you.
- All right.

539
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,881
Mr. Soprano?

540
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:31,226
You cannot accept a gift
like that from Tony Soprano! No way!

541
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:32,728
Listen to me, Charmaine...

542
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,356
...if I stick my hand up the ass of
one more lobster without a break...

543
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:37,858
...I'm gonna go postal.

544
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:41,403
I don't even want to talk about it
anymore, please!

545
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:45,699
Art, Melissa, come on, honey.
It's time to go home.

546
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:50,245
You have to get away.
We have to get away for the marriage.

547
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:55,500
No! It's bad enough that these
mobsters patronize the place, okay?

548
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:57,502
So what? We're not connected.

549
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:00,714
Right. Because we just
turned down those tickets!

550
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:04,634
But the tickets were comps.
Tony is a labor leader.

551
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,553
Arthur, please. Grow up!

552
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:10,599
Does the mind not rebel at any
scenario under which dentists...

553
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:15,520
...are sending the don of New Jersey
first class on a Norwegian steamship?

554
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:19,608
Come on, Arthur, somebody donated
their kneecaps for those tickets!

555
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:23,820
Herman, there is no way I can
subvert my fucking company.

556
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,157
Have them pay claims for MRIs
that never happened?

557
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:30,911
- The paperwork will look real.
- How do I not get caught?

558
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,289
I hate to hear you knocking yourself.
You're a smart guy.

559
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:38,251
I'm depressed. I'm so fucking
depressed I can't eat, sleep.

560
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,296
- You on Prozac?
- Zoloft. It's similar.

561
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,840
- It's supposed to help with gambling.
- No shit.

562
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,343
This new generation
of antidepressants...

563
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:49,596
...are supposed to be useful
against compulsive behaviors.

564
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,098
That's a shame.

565
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,850
A medication comes along
after your gambling...

566
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,478
...gets your fucking hip
busted to shit.

567
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:58,939
I'm trying not to be cynical.

568
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:03,068
Your debt and the feelings surrounding
it is the source of all your problems.

569
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,821
I'm sorry I haven't paid you, Herman.

570
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,489
I know you are.

571
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,950
And I never meant to
denigrate Tony Soprano.

572
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,702
- Want to walk on the rocks?
- Crutches, I can't.

573
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,956
It's beautiful out there.
Come on, we'll help you.

574
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,833
I go out there to think.

575
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:34,182
Thanks, but no.

576
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:38,353
Let's try it.

577
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:42,357
What you were saying before
with the MRIs and...

578
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,547
T!

579
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,134
Dick's looking for you!

580
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:13,889
Hey, Tony, I just heard
from Triborough Towers.

581
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:17,225
The Kolar brothers withdrew their bid.

582
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:18,727
That's good. That's good.

583
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:21,897
Listen, by the way,
Artie Bucco's here to see you.

584
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,441
- I gotta go, guys.
- Take care.

585
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,073
Artie!

586
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,367
Artie, you all right?

587
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,206
- I can't.
- What are you talking about?

588
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,292
We discussed this.
You gotta leave town.

589
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:43,793
I'm sorry.

590
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,303
This is unacceptable.

591
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:55,805
I made a reservation two weeks ago.

592
00:41:56,056 --> 00:42:00,060
Sir, people are not leaving, and there
are five parties ahead of you.

593
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,938
- So what would you like...?
- Can I help you?

594
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:07,442
I tore her a new one.

595
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:11,446
Why don't we just go
to another restaurant and eat?

596
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:12,948
We're here.

597
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,617
Mr. Soprano, how you doing?
Good to see you.

598
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,285
How you doing?

599
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,204
<i>- Signora.</i>
- Hello.

600
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,289
This way. Excuse me.

601
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:30,006
Sweetie-pie, I'm hungry.
Tony, where you going?

602
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:31,967
Hey. How are you?

603
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,635
Good.

604
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,638
You come here?

605
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,598
When possible.

606
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:43,770
Those decorating tips you gave me,
they really work.

607
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:45,981
Good.

608
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:48,984
How you doing?

609
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:55,490
Nils, Nils?

610
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,284
Do you know who that was?

611
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,161
Well, I mean, obviously you do.

612
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:01,997
What, is he a patient?

613
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,623
You know I can't say.

614
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:10,380
Decorating tips, yeah, right.

615
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:12,674
Nils, shut the fuck up.

616
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,885
Mr. Borglund, they're setting up
your table now.

617
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:19,014
Whoa.

618
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,851
Who was that woman at the restaurant?

619
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,519
My decorator.

620
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,188
What?
You're redoing the garbage dump?

621
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:30,692
That's funny. Hey, you better
not mess with that hat!

622
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:37,032
Come on, it's JFK's hat!
I bought it at that auction.

623
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,408
Give me that!

624
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:41,369
Irina, Jesus.

625
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:45,707
I know there is something more
intimate between you and her.

626
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,209
Nothing intimate. We just talk.

627
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:00,180
Mr. Soprano, <i>buona sera.</i>

628
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,390
We don't see you.
Where you been?

629
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:10,940
You know, sometimes...

630
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,401
...life is good.

631
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,570
Life is often good.

632
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:19,074
Regaleali, for example.

633
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:23,203
You've been in good spirits
the last couple days.

634
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:36,091
Carmela, there's something
I gotta confess.

635
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,096
What are you doing?

636
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:44,099
Getting my wine in position
to throw in your face!

637
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:45,600
You're always with the drama.

638
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:48,228
Confess already, please.
Get it over with!

639
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:54,776
I'm on Prozac.

640
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:57,612
Oh. Oh, my God.

641
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:00,156
I been seeing a therapist.

642
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:03,118
Oh, my God.
I think that's great.

643
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:06,413
I think that's wonderful!
I think that's so gutsy!

644
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,416
- Take it easy.
- But I think that's very wonderful.

645
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,584
You'd think I was Hannibal Lecter.

646
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:14,421
I think it's great.
Psychology doesn't address the soul.

647
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,464
But this is a start.
This is something.

648
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:18,591
Oh, I'm gonna shut up now.

649
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:20,635
I'll shut up now.

650
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:22,929
You're the only person who knows.

651
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:26,015
The only reason I'm telling you this
is because you're my wife.

652
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:29,644
You're the only person on this planet
that I'm completely honest with.

653
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,646
Oh, please.

654
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:33,481
Hey, goddamn it, I'm serious.

655
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,984
If the wrong person finds out,
I get a steel jacket...

656
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:38,528
...of antidepressant
in the back of the head.

657
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:50,665
I didn't realize you were so unhappy.

658
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:55,962
I don't know.

659
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:58,173
My mother...

660
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:00,216
You told him about your father, right?

661
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,178
- Who?
- Your therapist.

662
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,681
Yeah. Yeah, I told him.

663
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:10,685
Good. But your mother is the one.

664
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,024
I don't know, I just feel like lately
my life's out of balance.

665
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:22,363
Our existence on this earth
is a puzzle.

666
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:25,325
My own daughter hates me.

667
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:28,203
She doesn't hate you, Carm.

668
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:30,205
We were best friends.

669
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:33,666
Mothers and their daughters.
She'll come back to you.

670
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:39,881
- Hello?
<i>- Jesus!</i>

671
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,050
What's the matter, no social life?

672
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:43,718
Blow me.

673
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:46,346
Dad.

674
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:49,891
I brought you my primavera.
It's your favorite.

675
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:52,894
- Who is it?
- Christopher.

676
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,522
- Hey.
- Our friend is back in town.

677
00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:00,527
<i>"Little Pussy" Malanga,
confused with "Big Pussy" Bompensiero...</i>

678
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:02,612
<i>...had just returned from Florida...</i>

679
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:04,864
So it's gonna go down soon?

680
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:07,075
Don't worry.
I got a way to put it to bed.

681
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,537
Come on, Meadow.

682
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:14,082
- Go, Falcons!
- Come on, let's go!

683
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,210
So when do you need this by?

684
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:18,878
Right away.

685
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,590
- Way to go, Meadow!
- Beautiful, beautiful!

686
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:25,426
I think I can get a party
like that together.

687
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,264
- Side out? That ball hit the line!
- What are you doing, ref?

688
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,144
Mom didn't come?

689
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,438
Didn't think you wanted her to.

690
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:39,774
The car's over there.

691
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,610
Hey, Mr. Dante.
See you, Heather.

692
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,405
You guys played a good game.

693
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,448
Heather Dante.
Where'd she get that spike?

694
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:50,410
Don't you think it's
unfair what Mom is doing?

695
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:53,079
Making this little
movie scene out of it.

696
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:57,041
"The Sad Mom Who Can't Even Come
to Her Daughter's Sports Event."

697
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:04,799
Dad?

698
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,468
Don't you think it's
totally out there?

699
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:11,639
I mean, my Aspen trip.
What is she thinking?

700
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,100
Dad?

701
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,275
It's been years since I've been here.

702
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,069
Dad, please talk to her, please.

703
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:28,072
God, this is so stupid.

704
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,491
Why are we sitting here?

705
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:35,371
Your mother thinks you have the
capacity to be a top student.

706
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:36,831
And I agree.

707
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,833
What do you guys want, perfection?

708
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:43,671
What are you looking at?

709
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:47,675
Your great-grandfather
and his brother Frank...

710
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,178
...they built this place.

711
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,096
Big whoop.

712
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:55,516
Stone and marble workers.
They came over here from Italy...

713
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:58,519
...and they built this place.

714
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:02,357
Yeah, right. Two guys.

715
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:08,529
No, they were two guys on a crew of,
you know, laborers.

716
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:13,618
They didn't design it...

717
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:16,037
...but they knew how to build it.

718
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:21,376
Now find two guys who can
put decent grout around your bathtub.

719
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:00,415
So I feel good.

720
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:04,043
So I don't know if I'm
gonna be needing to come back.

721
00:50:04,544 --> 00:50:06,421
It's not the Prozac.

722
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:08,256
Why not?

723
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:13,594
You said you're thinking clearer and
your wife says you seem to be better?

724
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:16,931
It's not the medication.

725
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:22,729
Prozac takes weeks to build up
effective levels in the blood.

726
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:25,606
Well, what is it, then?

727
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:29,068
Coming here. Talking.

728
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:32,780
Hope comes in many forms.

729
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:35,116
Well, who's got time for that?

730
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:37,744
What is it you want to say to me?

731
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:49,297
I had a dream last night.

732
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:53,468
Uh...

733
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:58,014
My bellybutton was...

734
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:01,142
...a Phillips head screw...

735
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:04,312
...and I'm working unscrewing it...

736
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:06,981
...and when I get it unscrewed...

737
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,486
...my penis falls off.

738
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:20,161
You know, I pick it up and I'm holding
it and I'm running around...

739
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:23,831
...looking for the guy who used to
work on my Lincoln...

740
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,501
...so he can put it back on.

741
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,962
And you know, I'm holding it up...

742
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:34,133
...and this bird swoops down
and grabs it in its beak...

743
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:36,969
...and flies off with it.

744
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:43,017
What kind of bird?

745
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,188
I don't know. Sea gull or something.

746
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:48,773
A water bird?

747
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:53,069
I saw <i>The Birds</i> last week.
Think that planted the idea?

748
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,196
What else is a water bird?

749
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:59,200
Pelican, flamingo.

750
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,536
What about ducks?

751
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,002
Those goddamn ducks.

752
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:13,214
What is it about those ducks
that meant so much to you?

753
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:22,098
I don't know, it was a trip...

754
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:26,686
...having those wild creatures...

755
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:30,898
...come into my pool
and have their little babies.

756
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,824
I was sad to see them go.

757
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,912
Oh, Jesus, fuck. Now he's gonna cry.

758
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:55,423
Shit. Fuck me.

759
00:52:55,631 --> 00:53:00,761
When the ducks gave birth to those
babies, they became a family.

760
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:06,642
You're right.

761
00:53:07,435 --> 00:53:09,937
It's a link. A connection.

762
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,733
I'm afraid I'm gonna
lose my family...

763
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,902
...like I lost the ducks.

764
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:20,907
That's what I'm full of dread about.

765
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,577
It's always with me.

766
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,121
What are you so afraid's
going to happen?

767
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:29,874
I don't know.

768
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,381
You work so hard.

769
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:41,969
You work so damn hard
and to see your life's dream...

770
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:45,097
...burn down.

771
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,267
Look at it this way,
you collect the insurance.

772
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:51,604
You gotta say to yourself,
"It could have been worse."

773
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:55,524
How could it have been worse?
Fucking faulty stove!

774
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,819
Suppose people stopped coming,
ever think of that?

775
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:03,157
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck.

776
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:07,828
He's right.
There's no insurance for that.

777
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:12,708
Why would people stop coming to the
restaurant? It's just catching on.

778
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,170
You know what I'm
figuring out lately?

779
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,298
Talking helps.

780
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:21,634
- That's right.
- He's right. He's right.

781
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:28,349
Hope... comes in many forms.

782
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:30,184
Absolutely.

783
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:31,852
Come on.

784
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:35,064
Here, hold this.

785
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:36,565
Artie.

786
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,859
Artie, come on.

787
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,194
Hey, hey.

788
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,863
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

789
00:54:43,698 --> 00:54:45,533
I'll always help you.

790
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:48,202
Come on. Come on.

791
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:56,335
Go cook. Hey, let him cook.
He'll feel better.

792
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:12,226
Someday I'll tell him
we torched the restaurant.

793
00:55:17,732 --> 00:55:20,401
All right, enough of this shit.
What's wrong?

794
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,404
You know, a simple...

795
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:27,491
..."Way to go, Chris, on the Triborough
Towers contract!" would have been nice.

796
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:29,076
That's it.

797
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:39,628
You're right.

798
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:41,505
You're right.

799
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,133
I have no defense.

800
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:49,138
That's how I was parented.
Never supported. Never complimented.

801
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,557
My cousin Gregory's girlfriend...

802
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:54,935
...is what they call a development
girl, out in Hollywood.

803
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:57,897
She said I could sell my life story,
make fucking millions.

804
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,900
I didn't do that.
I stuck it out with you.

805
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:04,945
I'll fucking kill you.
Are you gonna go Henry Hill on me now?

806
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:08,282
You know how many mobsters are selling
screenplays and screwing things up?

807
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,659
She said I could maybe
even play myself.

808
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:12,453
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

809
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:20,628
Forget Hollywood screenplays.
Forget those distractions, huh?

810
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:24,173
What, you think I haven't had offers?

811
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:29,804
We got work to do. New avenues.

812
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:34,183
Everything's gonna be all right
from here on in. Come on.

813
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:38,813
Look, it's a beautiful day.
What could be bad?

814
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:44,652
It's nice of you to pick me up
for the party, Junior.

815
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:48,948
- At least somebody cares about me.
- These kids today.

816
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:52,660
I suppose he thinks once he's
got me in a nursing home...

817
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:57,665
...I'll die faster and then
he won't have to drive me anywhere.

818
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,084
If his father was still alive...

819
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:05,089
...you can bet he'd show more
decency and respect for his mother.

820
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,384
Well, my brother John
was a man among men.

821
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:11,220
He was a saint.

822
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:15,182
Lots of things are different now
from Johnny's and my day.

823
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:16,517
What do you mean?

824
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:19,228
I'm not free to run my business
like I want.

825
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:20,855
Aw, isn't that awful.

826
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:22,898
Just this week, your son
stuck his hand in...

827
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,317
...and made it 100 times
more difficult for me.

828
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:27,611
Plus, he thumbs his nose at New York.

829
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:32,199
What are you gonna do?
He's part of a whole generation.

830
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:36,162
Do you remember the crazy hair?
And the dope?

831
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,705
Now it's fags in the military.

832
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:40,749
Stop it, Junior.
You're making me very upset!

833
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:44,253
I don't like to, Livia,
but I'm <i>agita</i> all the time.

834
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:48,215
And I'll tell you something else,
things are down all across the board.

835
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:50,759
A lot of friends of ours
are complaining.

836
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:54,513
We used to be recession-proof.
No more.

837
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:58,267
You can't blame it all
on the Justice Department.

838
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:01,645
Our friends say to me...

839
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:06,567
..."Junior, why don't you
take a larger hand in things?"

840
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:12,907
Something may have to be done, Livia,
about Tony.

841
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:15,159
I don't know.

842
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,543
There they are.
Hey, Ma, Uncle Jun.

843
00:58:24,752 --> 00:58:29,590
You're using mesquite.
That makes the sausage taste peculiar.

844
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:33,302
- Hi, Grandma.
- Happy birthday, my big boy.

845
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:34,929
Carmela, my mother's here.

846
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:37,681
Everybody, let's eat.
